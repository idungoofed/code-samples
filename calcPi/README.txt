A simple program that calculates the value of pi based on the infinite series pi = 4(1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7...).
To compile the program, use the command "make".
If you wish to compile it yourself instead of using the provided Makefile, the command is "gcc calcPi.c -Wall -std=c99 -o calcPi".
The executable is named "calcPi" and is already provided.
