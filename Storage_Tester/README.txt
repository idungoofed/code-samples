A program to stress-test a computer's hard drive by creating 1Mb files 
until the hard drive is full and then removing them, and then repeating 
the process. After running the script "testing", run "End_Testing" whenever 
you wish to end the test, and the program will quit on its next cycle.
Run "make" if for some reason you force-quit the program at any point.
